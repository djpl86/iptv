# iptv

Daily iptv list mashup, contains channels and on demand video from all around the world.

Sometimes the list is too big for git, tried using git large file storage but it's too slow

I'm open for suggestions, the idea is to keep the list raw and not compressed, might aswell get split into smaller ones

for now if it surpasses the 100mb limit you can grab it here: https://gitlab.com/djpl86/iptv

*EDIT* gitlab works like a charm with large file storage
